# hello-world
Hello world, it's me, Sean

First thing you should know about me is that I usually keep pretty much to myself and am quiet until I actually get to know you. Also, I'm an avid reader of books and I sometimes write stories as a hobby. I also like to play video games and browsing the internet, as well as being a dog-person. I don't play much sports. Having taking archery lessons once during the summer, I have some skill in that but not enough to boast that I am efficient at it. Other than that, I mostly rethink my words before saying it, not really one for spurting thoughts off from my head.
